Gal Gadot look stunning.
Zegler can sing.

Negatives.
You tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. 
Thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing Snow White made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. 

She might have very well played the best Snow White on screen but many will see a ""Mean, Disrespectful, and very Unlikeable"" person as Snow White.
That will ultimately hurt sales for this movie.

The CG in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. The Dwarves in particular just didn't quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors.

All in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, Snow White's departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story (and in essence, the soul of this story) is just too much of a stretch and neither I nor my family will be supporting it.",@ArchonSG1,10,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,Snow White,447273,"positives gal gadot look stunning. zegler can sing. negatives. you tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing snow white made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. she might have very well played the best snow white on screen but many will see a mean, disrespectful, and very unlikeable person as snow white. that will ultimately hurt sales for this movie. the cg in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. the dwarves in particular just did not quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors. all in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, snow whites departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story and in essence, the soul of this story is just too much of a stretch and neither i nor my family will be supporting it.",positive,0.16852597402597402,0.5003571428571427

We saw he was a prisoner because doing some violation and Snow White wanted to show some mercy, but the Evil Queen rejected that idea. 
Later, we will see the Evil Queen took over the whole country and Snow White have to return to her kingdom, take the kingdom back and defeat Evil Queen. 
I already imagined a huge different storyline pattern compared with Classic cartoon version, but I felt intrigued how does this version delivered.

UgxNls0XaFtTg5h9wex4AaABAg,"Where do I even begin? Oh, right, the exploding people. Yes, you read that correctly. Not just one exploding person, mind you, but a veritable symphony of exploding people. It's like the filmmakers decided to replace character development with a fireworks display of gore. And the gore? Let's just say it looked like they raided the clearance aisle of a Halloween prop store.

The script? It's less a script and more a collection of random grunts, screams, and the occasional, ""Where's the monkey?"" Said monkey, by the way, is a plush and plastic toy that apparently possesses the power to turn humans into fleshy pi√±atas. No explanation, no backstory, just... splat. It's like the writers were playing a game of Mad Libs with a horror movie plot and the results were, shall we say, ""unique.""

And the editing? Oh, the editing. They seem to have taken inspiration from a blender. We're treated to a rapid-fire montage of limbs, torsos, and close-ups of eyeballs, all set to a soundtrack that sounds like a dial-up modem having a seizure. It's less a movie and more a visual assault on the senses.

The ""plot"" (again, using that word generously) revolves around... well, I'm not entirely sure. Something about a cursed monkey toy and a group of people who apparently won a contest to see who could make the worst life choices. The acting is on par with a high school play performed by sleepwalkers.

Honestly, I'm baffled. I'm genuinely perplexed as to how this film got made. Did someone accidentally fund a fever dream? Did a group of toddlers take over a film set? I have so many questions, and none of them involve the monkey.

""Monkey"" isn't just bad; it's an insult to bad movies. It's the cinematic equivalent of a moldy sandwich left in a hot car. It's a testament to the fact that sometimes, money is indeed wasted.

UgzNdyUIVZfmyfabzrB4AaABAg,"If they have to say ""most scariest movle you would ever see"" then save your money. It's a waste of money and I have bet hundreds of people in the past and in recent years if a movie will be worth it or if the producers are desperately trying to have a break even opening weekend to pay the banks back with your hustled money. I can tell by the producers, advertisements, lack of known actors, amount of actors paid, plot or subject matter and director. Horror movies are the cheapest to produce.

my opinion : 
the movie started out pretty raw and real. the dialogue the characters were having felt so real unlike typical movie lines. it felt like you are watching a cctv footage of real people. and then comes evan. started out as expected , chill casual and everything. but wtf ? how did she think he was fr when he asked to marry her ? i thought her reaction would be like r u serious and like this is my job to please people. but she just accepted the proposal. and when torus and guys confronted them, she was acting like this marriage was real and she was defending it with all her might. her acting felt very good like real person would react in that situation.

then came court scene. turns out marriage cant be annuled if married in nevada. after being thrown out of court, she was trying to convince him to stay together and brother was not ggiving 2 fks. at that point. i closed it. i didnt want to watch anymore of that. 

trust me the acting was amazing but the plot was not it.

edit :
ok i watched it and that divorce scene was hilarious. that comeback anora gave to evan's mother was crazy lol. 
but the plane scene was predictable. i knew evan was not really in love with her. he bought her with money. fked her and partied with her. but never treated her like a lover would.

UgyMRd9JHwYiJSDQQCt4AaABAg,"I first saw these when I was a youngster in the 70s. I was enthralled beyond words. I've seen ""The Godfather"" and its sequel ""The Godfather Part II"" countless times, and I swear that each time I view them I learn or discover something new. Strangely, I learned to appreciate these movies even more so because of my love of the ""Star Wars"" films, I kid you not. Permit me to explain... 

I remember watching the two people who were arguably considered the greatest movie reviewers ever: Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. When ""The Empire Strikes Back"" came out in 1980, I remember both Gene and Roger discussing how they both believed that movie was up there with The Godfather Part II as the two greatest sequels ever produced. When I first heard that, I immediately thought they were nuts. One movie was a science fiction space action movie, while the other was a fictional tale of a Mafia family, but complete with almost non-fiction allusions to reality. 

Gene and Roger explained why they thought they were both so good. One of the main reasons was that both of the sequels ended in tragedy, sadness, and despair. The Godfather Part II saw Michael murder his own brother, while The Empire Strikes Back saw Darth Vader almost kill his own son; he cut off his son's arm. Vader also captured and immobilized Han Solo, handing him off to another evil individual. In both movies there were also a number of other deaths occuring around those main ones. In short, both movies defied the conventional good-guys-beat-the-bad-guys plot and ending. 

In doing so, these two sequels caused a lot of people to think, perhaps ask questions, rhetorical or otherwise, and not just about whether there would be another sequel to follow. Of course we know the answer to that, as The Return of the Jedi premiered in May 1983 and The Godfather Part III premiered in December 1990.

As I got older, I began to relook at these movies, the sequels included, in a different light, one that went beyond typical cinematic presentation. I also began to pay more attention to and thoroughly enjoy movie scores (their soundtracks), which in turn led to me enjoy orchestral music and concerts. First Nina Rota then John Williams helped me to appreciate the artistry behind an orchestra, its musicians, and their musical pieces. For that and more I can thank the true geniuses behind two movies that were from two genres that were about as far apart on the spectrum one would think.",@Umpire25,1,2022-08-23 21:35:21+00:00,2022-10-23 19:28:30+00:00,The Godfather,238,"i first saw these when i was a youngster in the 70s. i was enthralled beyond words. i have seen the godfather and its sequel the godfather part ii countless times, and i swear that each time i view them i learn or discover something new. strangely, i learned to appreciate these movies even more so because of my love of the star wars films, i kid you not. permit me to explain... i remember watching the two people who were arguably considered the greatest movie reviewers ever gene siskel and roger ebert. when the empire strikes back came out in 1980, i remember both gene and roger discussing how they both believed that movie was up there with the godfather part ii as the two greatest sequels ever produced. when i first heard that, i immediately thought they were nuts. one movie was a science fiction space action movie, while the other was a fictional tale of a mafia family, but complete with almost nonfiction allusions to reality. gene and roger explained why they thought they were both so good. one of the main reasons was that both of the sequels ended in tragedy, sadness, and despair. the godfather part ii saw michael murder his own brother, while the empire strikes back saw darth vader almost kill his own son he cut off his sons arm. vader also captured and immobilized han solo, handing him off to another evil individual. in both movies there were also a number of other deaths occuring around those main ones. in short, both movies defied the conventional goodguysbeatthebadguys plot and ending. in doing so, these two sequels caused a lot of people to think, perhaps ask questions, rhetorical or otherwise, and not just about whether there would be another sequel to follow. of course we know the answer to that, as the return of the jedi premiered in may 1983 and the godfather part iii premiered in december 1990. as i got older, i began to relook at these movies, the sequels included, in a different light, one that went beyond typical cinematic presentation. i also began to pay more attention to and thoroughly enjoy movie scores their soundtracks, which in turn led to me enjoy orchestral music and concerts. first nina rota then john williams helped me to appreciate the artistry behind an orchestra, its musicians, and their musical pieces. for that and more i can thank the true geniuses behind two movies that were from two genres that were about as far apart on the spectrum one would think.",positive,0.16163023967902015,0.4758948368704466

Based on a CHILLING true story and the documentary of the same name, of the underwater accident that left Chris Lemons with only 10 minutes of oxygen and 29 in physical and mental limbo without it, as Duncan Alloc, Dave Yuasa, and the rest of the ship crew have to rescue him. A VERY well directed, PHENOMENALLY edited, WONDERFULLY acted, and MASTERFULLY scored and shot movie. Alex Parkinson knocked it out of the park with how much emotion and tension he was able to balance scene by scene. The editing, including one moment where the audio abruptly cuts, and cuts HARD, leaving us in silence, and then drifting back in, also remarkable. Paul Leonard-Morgan‚Äôs soundtrack also hit right where it needed to in those moments of tension, emotion, and overall atmosphere.
