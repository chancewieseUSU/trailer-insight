Gal Gadot look stunning.
Zegler can sing.

Negatives.
You tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. 
Thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing Snow White made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. 

She might have very well played the best Snow White on screen but many will see a ""Mean, Disrespectful, and very Unlikeable"" person as Snow White.
That will ultimately hurt sales for this movie.

The CG in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. The Dwarves in particular just didn't quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors.

All in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, Snow White's departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story (and in essence, the soul of this story) is just too much of a stretch and neither I nor my family will be supporting it.",@ArchonSG1,10,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,Snow White,447273,"positives gal gadot look stunning. zegler can sing. negatives. you tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing snow white made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. she might have very well played the best snow white on screen but many will see a mean, disrespectful, and very unlikeable person as snow white. that will ultimately hurt sales for this movie. the cg in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. the dwarves in particular just did not quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors. all in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, snow whites departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story and in essence, the soul of this story is just too much of a stretch and neither i nor my family will be supporting it.",positive,0.16852597402597402,0.5003571428571427

We saw he was a prisoner because doing some violation and Snow White wanted to show some mercy, but the Evil Queen rejected that idea. 
Later, we will see the Evil Queen took over the whole country and Snow White have to return to her kingdom, take the kingdom back and defeat Evil Queen. 
I already imagined a huge different storyline pattern compared with Classic cartoon version, but I felt intrigued how does this version delivered.

UgxNls0XaFtTg5h9wex4AaABAg,"Where do I even begin? Oh, right, the exploding people. Yes, you read that correctly. Not just one exploding person, mind you, but a veritable symphony of exploding people. It's like the filmmakers decided to replace character development with a fireworks display of gore. And the gore? Let's just say it looked like they raided the clearance aisle of a Halloween prop store.

The script? It's less a script and more a collection of random grunts, screams, and the occasional, ""Where's the monkey?"" Said monkey, by the way, is a plush and plastic toy that apparently possesses the power to turn humans into fleshy pi√±atas. No explanation, no backstory, just... splat. It's like the writers were playing a game of Mad Libs with a horror movie plot and the results were, shall we say, ""unique.""

And the editing? Oh, the editing. They seem to have taken inspiration from a blender. We're treated to a rapid-fire montage of limbs, torsos, and close-ups of eyeballs, all set to a soundtrack that sounds like a dial-up modem having a seizure. It's less a movie and more a visual assault on the senses.

The ""plot"" (again, using that word generously) revolves around... well, I'm not entirely sure. Something about a cursed monkey toy and a group of people who apparently won a contest to see who could make the worst life choices. The acting is on par with a high school play performed by sleepwalkers.

Honestly, I'm baffled. I'm genuinely perplexed as to how this film got made. Did someone accidentally fund a fever dream? Did a group of toddlers take over a film set? I have so many questions, and none of them involve the monkey.

""Monkey"" isn't just bad; it's an insult to bad movies. It's the cinematic equivalent of a moldy sandwich left in a hot car. It's a testament to the fact that sometimes, money is indeed wasted.
