1. Steve doesn't seem to be wearing an elytra when he jumps off
2. The only names shown in the subtitles are Steve and VP Marlene
3. The creeper walking is shown as 'crunching' in the subtitles, possible referring to the original idea of creepers being like plants
4. The subtitles say 'nitwit groaning' when the villager gets hit
5. In the opening scene, when Steve does a water bucket clutch, the other characters are wearing elytra, probably suggesting they don't know how to use them properly yet
6. When the pandas fall back to the ground, you can see the separate parts of the elytra stuck in the ground
7. There are apples on the trees at 0:25
8. At 0:33 there's a full theme park with a rollercoaster in the right of the background
9. When Garrett Garrison says ""Vaya con Dios,"" it seems the group is heading back into the real world
10. At 1:09, in the upper right, there is a hanging sign that says 'Steve's Lava Chicken!'
11. At 1:10, Steve is holding a sword and shield, and the kid is holding an item that looks a bit like a megaphone (edit: apparently it's a potato cannon, thanks @TheOneWhoTalksALot)
11. At 1:35, Steve seems to be holding onto Garrett Garrison since Steve doesn't have an elytra
12. At 1:38, when the creeper lights up, there seems to be the creeper's skeleton visible inside
13. At 2:00, there are pillagers around the boxing ring
14. At 0:21, the dog teleports to Steve as he builds the villager heads (ty to @mazekart4972 and @microvive30)

But what if the twist is  the complete opposite: that there‚Äôs actually two killers, they‚Äôre a couple, and their idea of a double date is killing other couples.
































Edit: Thanks for all the likes! I have now seen the movie. I loved it! I think there are some pacing issues in the drive-in theater scene, and the climax has some obnoxious exposition and confusing circumstances surrounding a bullet wound, but overall, the film was consistently thrilling, funny, and sweet throughout. 

The opening scene is incredibly strong and establishes the tone, visual style, and humor of the film very well. I loved the cinematography throughout: I enjoyed its color palette, and something about the film‚Äôs compositions really appeals to me. 
 
I found the characters likable and very well performed. I loved how they fought the killer together, it was a great way to marry the slasher and romance genres, transforming the act of fighting a serial killer into a method by which the couple could bond. 

I have mixed thoughts on the killer‚Äôs costume. I love the heart eyes, and in the right lighting (as seen in the poster, which notably enshrouds the entirety of their lower body in darkness), the costume looks great. But in some ways, it‚Äôs generic. I do like the silhouette and movement of their coat, but its pure black color scheme is kind of uncreative and clashes with the mask, which I think is meant to be evocative of a cherub, and doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with the rest of the costume. 

Perhaps they could have added something evocative of wings to the coat to bridge the head to the rest of the body. I also have mixed thoughts on the mask: I can‚Äôt decide whether I like or dislike its veiny texture. On another note, the killer‚Äôs arsenal is great and fits their motif very well.

Overall, I had great time, and of course, it was great to see my prediction was somewhat correct! I give it a 7-8/10, or a 75-80/100. My thoughts on some of the film‚Äôs aspects are not entirely set in stone, but I‚Äôm fairly positive about these scores.

Negatives.
You tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. 
Thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing Snow White made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. 

She might have very well played the best Snow White on screen but many will see a ""Mean, Disrespectful, and very Unlikeable"" person as Snow White.
That will ultimately hurt sales for this movie.

The CG in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. The Dwarves in particular just didn't quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors.

All in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, Snow White's departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story (and in essence, the soul of this story) is just too much of a stretch and neither I nor my family will be supporting it.",@ArchonSG1,10,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,Snow White,447273,"positives gal gadot look stunning. zegler can sing. negatives. you tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing snow white made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. she might have very well played the best snow white on screen but many will see a mean, disrespectful, and very unlikeable person as snow white. that will ultimately hurt sales for this movie. the cg in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. the dwarves in particular just did not quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors. all in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, snow whites departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story and in essence, the soul of this story is just too much of a stretch and neither i nor my family will be supporting it.",positive,0.16852597402597402

""1. Violet's Connection to the Threats: It's possible that Violet's past, particularly her history with domestic abuse, is intricately linked to the current threats. Perhaps the tormentor is someone from her past seeking revenge or closure, making Violet's own history the catalyst for the night's events.‚Äã

2. Henry's Hidden Agenda: Henry, the date who seems charming at first, might have a concealed motive. He could be orchestrating the threats to test Violet's reactions or to manipulate her into a compromising situation, revealing a darker side to his character.‚Äã

3. The Tormentor's Identity: The person sending the threats might be someone unexpected, like Violet's sister or even her son, possibly influenced or coerced by external forces, adding layers of betrayal and familial tension to the story.‚Äã

4. A Digital Deception: Given the modern setting, the threats could be part of a larger digital scheme, such as a hacked device or a viral prank gone wrong, leading to a commentary on the dangers of digital connectivity and privacy invasion.‚Äã

5. Psychological Manipulation: The entire ordeal might be a psychological experiment or a form of gaslighting, where Violet's perceptions are manipulated to question her reality, blurring the lines between what's real and what's orchestrated.""
