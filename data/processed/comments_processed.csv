Gal Gadot look stunning.
Zegler can sing.

Negatives.
You tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. 
Thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing Snow White made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. 

She might have very well played the best Snow White on screen but many will see a ""Mean, Disrespectful, and very Unlikeable"" person as Snow White.
That will ultimately hurt sales for this movie.

The CG in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. The Dwarves in particular just didn't quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors.

All in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, Snow White's departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story (and in essence, the soul of this story) is just too much of a stretch and neither I nor my family will be supporting it.",@ArchonSG1,10,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,2024-12-21 00:12:11+00:00,Snow White,447273,"positives gal gadot look stunning. zegler can sing. negatives. you tried to hide it, but you can still tell that this is a girl boss movie. thematically this would not be an issue but, unfortunately the actress playing snow white made it impossible to separate the character from the actress. she might have very well played the best snow white on screen but many will see a mean, disrespectful, and very unlikeable person as snow white. that will ultimately hurt sales for this movie. the cg in the movie looks really good in certain scenes, but more often then not, pulls you out of immersion with really bad uncanny valley images. the dwarves in particular just did not quite translate well during the animation process, they really should have used live actors. all in all, hope that those who can enjoy this movie will do so, for me, snow whites departure from the true innocent as portrayed in the original movie and the radical change to the story and in essence, the soul of this story is just too much of a stretch and neither i nor my family will be supporting it.",positive,0.16852597402597402

UgyXk996fYCm1y5AHqF4AaABAg,"Everyone here is predicting that the killer will be motivated by a loneliness induced  hatred of couples, which is fairly reasonable. But what if the twist is  the complete opposite: that there‚Äôs actually two killers, they‚Äôre a couple, and their idea of a double date is killing other couples.
































Edit: Thanks for all the likes! I have now seen the movie. I loved it! I think there are some pacing issues in the drive-in theater scene, and the climax has some obnoxious exposition and confusing circumstances surrounding a bullet wound, but overall, the film was consistently thrilling, funny, and sweet throughout. 

The opening scene is incredibly strong and establishes the tone, visual style, and humor of the film very well. I loved the cinematography throughout: I enjoyed its color palette, and something about the film‚Äôs compositions really appeals to me. 
 
I found the characters likable and very well performed. I loved how they fought the killer together, it was a great way to marry the slasher and romance genres, transforming the act of fighting a serial killer into a method by which the couple could bond. 

I have mixed thoughts on the killer‚Äôs costume. I love the heart eyes, and in the right lighting (as seen in the poster, which notably enshrouds the entirety of their lower body in darkness), the costume looks great. But in some ways, it‚Äôs generic. I do like the silhouette and movement of their coat, but its pure black color scheme is kind of uncreative and clashes with the mask, which I think is meant to be evocative of a cherub, and doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with the rest of the costume. 

Perhaps they could have added something evocative of wings to the coat to bridge the head to the rest of the body. I also have mixed thoughts on the mask: I can‚Äôt decide whether I like or dislike its veiny texture. On another note, the killer‚Äôs arsenal is great and fits their motif very well.

Overall, I had great time, and of course, it was great to see my prediction was somewhat correct! I give it a 7-8/10, or a 75-80/100. My thoughts on some of the film‚Äôs aspects are not entirely set in stone, but I‚Äôm fairly positive about these scores.

- Miranda Otto's narration sounds perfect
- Beautiful scenery such as Helm's Deep, Edoras, the high mountains, and forests. Each location feels distinct and cohesive in its aesthetic
- The horses are very well-drawn
- The men of the Rohirrim are dressed excellently, and outfits are varied according to whether they are at leisure, riding to war, etc., but still with a cohesion that conveys a well-fleshed out culture
- Helm's daughter's dresses in the beginning shots are beautiful, reminiscent of Miranda Otto as Eowyn without being identical
- Inclusion of a range of more fantastical Middle Earth features (e.g. Orcs, Great Eagles, Mumakil, a creature similar to the Watcher of the Deep)
- Great line delivery by a number of characters (e.g. Brian Cox: ""My pride, my joy"")
- Multiple perspectives (e.g. Helm's daughter on her journey vs  the Rohirrim defending Rohan) and subplots (e.g. the person collecting rings) - hopefully these will be well-balanced and interwoven

Negative:
- Multiple LOTR clips for the first 15-20 seconds feels a little heavy handed (though this is a minor point, as the transition with ""through the eyes of legendary director Kenji Kamiyama"" was good)
- Dunlending outfits look a tad generic (with the exception of Wulf and his father)
- Brian Cox's delivery of his speech to his men might be accused of drawing too heavily from Bernard Hill
